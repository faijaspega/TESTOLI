For older Plug-Ins without specific images for menu buttons (showing the small blue cog), image files can be placed in thes directory.

The naming convention is [name of tab].[name of button].png (or bmp)
Without the dots in tab name or menu name.

for example, for a Plug-In with a tab name of "Demo Plug-In" with a menu name "Menu 1..." the filename should be:

Demo Plug-In.Menu 1.png

or

Demo Plug-In.Menu 1.bmp
